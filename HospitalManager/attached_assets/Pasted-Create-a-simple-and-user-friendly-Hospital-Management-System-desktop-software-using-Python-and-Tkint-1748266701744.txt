Create a simple and user-friendly Hospital Management System desktop software using Python and Tkinter. The software should work fully offline and store all data locally in files (such as JSON, CSV, or pickle ‚Äì no external database). It should have a clean UI so that anyone (non-technical hospital staff) can easily use it.

Include the following 4 core modules with appropriate UI forms and functionality:

‚úÖ 1. Patient Management

Register new patients with: Name, Age, Gender, Contact, Address, and Phone number

Assign each patient a unique Patient ID automatically

Allow editing and updating patient information

Allow searching patients by anything like gender or name aga or phone number any thing using filters

View patient history (appointments, diagnosis, prescriptions)

‚úÖ 2. Appointment Scheduling

Book appointments for patients with available doctors

Show available time slots for each doctor

Reschedule or cancel appointments

View upcoming appointments in a calendar-like or list format

Filters by doctor or department

‚úÖ 3. Outpatient (OPD) Management

Quick OPD check-in for existing patients

Capture symptoms, diagnosis, and prescription

Optionally assign lab tests or medicines (extension)

Track follow-ups if needed

Show visit summary

‚úÖ 4. Reporting Module

Generate reports:

Daily, weekly, and monthly patient visits

Appointment summary

Doctor-wise consultations

Ability to filter reports by date range and doctor

Export reports to PDF or CSV

Optionally show simple graphs like bar/pie charts

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements:

Use Tkinter for GUI

Use JSON, CSV, or Pickle for file-based local data storage

Code should be clean and modular, split into separate files if needed (e.g., main.py, patient.py, utils.py, etc.)

No external libraries required except for built-in modules (for portability)

Provide a simple, attractive GUI that any receptionist or admin can operate

üí° Bonus (Optional):

PDF export for prescriptions and reports using ReportLab (if allowed)

Local backup and restore option for patient data

Make everything simple, reliable, and easy to understand for beginners. This is for a local small hospital that needs basic management software.
